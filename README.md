   <ul> 
      <li>Creating a new repository on GitHub</li>
      <li>Cloning the repository</li> 
      <li>Using git commands (add, commit, and push)</li> 
      <li>Creating an HTML boilerplate</li> 
      <li>Creating headings and paragraphs</li> 
      <li>Creating relative links</li> 
      <li>Creating unordered and ordered lists</li> 
      <li>Adding an image with appropriate alt text and image size attributes</li> 
      <li>Publishing my recipes website to be accesible to others via the web</li>
      </ul>
