        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is a super easy to make creamy corn casserole that is great as a side dish for holiday dinners or even for dinner during the week. The ingredients are easy-to-find and include whole kernel and creamed corn, cornbread mix, sour cream, butter, and eggs. Depending on the occasion, you can get creative and customize it to your taste! You can make it a little sweeter by adding honey, creamier by adding a cup of sharp cheddar cheese, or spicier by adding diced poblano pepper. Or add all 3!</p>
        <p>This recipe requires 10 minutes of prep time and 45 minutes of cook time. It uses a 9-inch casserole and should serve 8. However, if preparing this dish for a larger get-together, the ingredients can be doubled and baked in a 9x13-inch baking dish and requires almost the same amount of cooking time.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can of whole kernel corn, drained</li>
            <li>1 (14.75 ounce) can of creamed corn</li>
            <li>1 (8.5 ounce) package of dry cornbread mix</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix whole and creamed corn, cornbread mix, sour cream, melted butter, and eggs together in a medium bowl until well combined. If adding any additional ingredients to the recipe, this is the time to add them and mix them in well. Spoon the mixture into the prepared dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (about 45 minutes).</li>
        </ol>
